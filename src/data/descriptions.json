My principle is simple: I don't just create 3D art; I design and build the procedural systems that generate it. I have validated this focus on creating efficient and scalable tools by building a successful 3D asset business, generating over $200,000 in revenue. I am now looking to apply this systems-thinking approach and my problem-solving skills in a team environment, contributing to large-scale projects."
