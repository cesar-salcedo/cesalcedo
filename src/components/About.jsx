                <p> I'm CÃ©sar Salcedo,</p>
                <p>
                    a Technical Artist with over 10 years of experience and a passion for solving complex technical puzzles.
                    My principle is simple: I don't just create 3D art; I design and build the procedural systems that generate it.
                    I have validated this focus on creating efficient and scalable tools by building a successful 3D asset business, generating over $200,000 in revenue.
                    I am now looking to apply this systems-thinking approach and my problem-solving skills in a team environment, contributing to large-scale projects.
